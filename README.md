# jarvis
Fun project where I try to create my own Jarvis AI. This is different form most personal assistant AIs where commands are hardcoded. In this project, I plan on having the AI not be able to do anything, but map my voice commands to actions based on context and other sensory information. I'm thinking about having a bunch of raspberry Pi sensors throughout my apartment and have them send sensory information to a node server.

Using Google Cloud Speech API for speech to text. I copied much of that code from the cloud tutorials.

Future plans: ML model to map novel commands to action.


Using python for the ML algo and nodejs + express for the web framework
